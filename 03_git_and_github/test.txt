    <h1>Lines of Code</h1>
    <p>
        In brackets and tags, we build and create,<br>
        HTML structures, both simple and great.<br>
        With divs and spans, we craft the design,<br>
        Semantic markup, each element in line.<br>
        <br>
        Classes and IDs to style and control,<br>
        Functions and logic to achieve our goal.<br>
        From algorithms to pixel-perfect views,<br>
        Coding's the art where logic and beauty fuse.<br>
        <br>
        Through debugging nights and problems we solve,<br>
        Our passion for code will forever evolve.
